# Fake_Real_News_NLP

Welcome to the **Fake_Real_News_NLP** repository! This project is dedicated to identifying and classifying fake and real news articles using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Utilizing comprehensive datasets of labeled news articles, the project aims to enhance the accuracy of fake news detection.

## Project Overview

**Fake_Real_News_NLP** leverages two distinct datasets containing 'Fake' and 'Real' news articles to train machine learning models capable of distinguishing between them. This initiative is crucial in today's digital age, where misinformation can spread widely and quickly.

### Data Preparation

The datasets initially consist of separate CSV files for fake and real news, which are combined and preprocessed to form a unified dataset. The preprocessing steps include:
- Removing duplicates and irrelevant features such as dates and subjects.
- Cleaning text data by stripping HTML tags, special characters, and emojis.
- Standardizing text to lower case for uniformity.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Analysis involves:
- Visualizing the distribution of article lengths and word counts to understand the data better.
- Examining the balance of labels to ensure model training effectiveness.

## Model Training and Evaluation

We compare various NLP pipelines and machine learning models to determine the most effective in classifying news articles. Models tested include:
- Logistic Regression
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forests
- Gradient Boosting Machines

The performance of these models is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Objectives

- **Enhance Detection Accuracy**: Improve the capability to accurately identify fake news articles.
- **Optimize NLP Models**: Refine NLP models to handle diverse and complex text data effectively.
- **Improve Scalability**: Ensure the models are scalable and can handle large volumes of data efficiently.

## Conclusion

The **Fake_Real_News_NLP** project aims to build robust models that can accurately classify news articles as fake or real, contributing to the fight against misinformation in the media landscape. It serves as a foundation for further research and development in the domain of digital information verification.
